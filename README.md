# Human Evolution System

This is an evolving human simulation system designed to model traits, behaviors, reproduction, and population dynamics. It has evolved through a combination of ChatGPT-generated logic and human guidance to fix basic errors and enhance functionality. The system now includes new features such as **health insurance** and **inheritance**, with more advanced features like **house renting** planned for the future.

## Features

### **Human Traits**
- Humans in the system possess various traits that influence their behavior and interactions. These include:
  - **Social Skills**: Affects social interactions, friendships, and cooperation.
  - **Physical Strength**: Impacts health and survival capabilities.
  - **Intelligence**: Affects decision-making and problem-solving.
  - **Empathy**: Affects social interactions, especially in terms of cooperation and conflict resolution.

### **Behavior Types**
- Humans can exhibit different behavior types, such as:
  - **Aggressive**
  - **Cooperative**
  - **Friendly**
  - These behaviors influence how humans interact with one another, affecting traits like health and emotional well-being.

### **Reproduction**
- Humans reproduce based on **trait compatibility**.
- The simulation models how traits are passed down across generations, adding complexity as the population evolves. **Children inherit traits from their parents** during reproduction with potential **mutations** occurring to the traits.

### **Population Management**
- The population of humans grows and ages over time.
- **Death rate increases with age**, influenced by health and environmental factors.

### **Health Insurance**
- Humans now have **health insurance** which they need to pay or their health will decrease.

### **Inheritance**
- Upon death, humans can pass down **wealth** through inheritance. 
- The inheritance system ensures that **children receive material wealth**, which impacts their future life choices and socioeconomic status.

### **House Renting (Upcoming Feature)**
- **House renting** will be implemented in the near future, allowing humans to rent homes, manage payments, and form households.
- Renting will be influenced by **house rating**, **location**, and **affordability**, impacting the social structure of the population.
- Families or groups of individuals will share homes, with rent being distributed among all adult household members.

## How It Works

1. **Human Generation**: Humans are generated with traits such as intelligence, physical strength, and social skills.
2. **Interaction**: Humans interact with each other, influencing their mental and physical health, as well as their social behaviors.
3. **Reproduction**: Humans with compatible traits can reproduce, passing down genetic traits to their children. Mutations may occur in offspring.
4. **Health Insurance**: Humans need to make sure they pay their health insurance to avoid health decline.
5. **Inheritance**: Upon death, humans pass on their material wealth to their children.
6. **Population Dynamics**: The population evolves through aging, reproduction, and inheritance, adapting to the changing environment and interactions.

## Running the Simulation

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Compile and run the project in your Java environment.
3. Observe the evolution of the human population over time, with new systems like health insurance and inheritance.

## Future Features

- **More Detailed Traits**: Additional traits such as **wealth** and **cultural influence** will be added.
- **Behavioral Decisions**: Advanced decision-making based on human traits, socioeconomic status, and health.
- **Graphical Interface**: A visual representation of humans, houses, and population dynamics.
- **House Renting**: Implementing house renting where humans will manage rental payments, living arrangements, and economic stability.
- **Economy System**: An advanced economic system for managing wealth, resources, and community welfare.

This system was developed as an experiment to explore the complexity of human evolution and social dynamics. It was primarily steered by **ChatGPT** with human guidance to address issues and enhance the system's complexity. The collaboration between AI and human input ensures that the simulation becomes more dynamic and realistic over time.
